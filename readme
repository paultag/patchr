Oy, you've found me.

This is a bunch of paultag's scripts, if you read them you'll probably understand what they are.

They were originally created for the fluxbox github mirror, and paultag published them after a *wee* bit of proddin'. Ok, a lot. 

It even includes a lovely email written by Paul's Daemon! He's very polite.
